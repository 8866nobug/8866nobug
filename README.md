// Hi, I'm 8866, a beginner programmer from China. I am fascinated by everything about computers because I believe they can change the world.

//Currently, I have learned the basics of C and C++ languages. Besides the exercises in books, I haven't done many other projects. However, recently, I wrote a small graphical program using the Easy_X library, which made me very happy for a long time.

//In the next stage, I plan to study algorithms and computer hardware. I might write some blog posts to share my experiences and exchange ideas with others.

//This is my first time writing on GitHub, and I hope to make friends through programming and contribute my small part to changing the world through coding!
